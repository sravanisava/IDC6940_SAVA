# Literature Review: Loan Default Risk Prediction
## Background and Motivation

LendingClub is a pioneering peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers and investors through a streamlined digital interface. Its rapid growth in the financial technology sector has introduced unique challenges, notably the management of credit risk due to loan defaults. Identifying high-risk borrowers is critical to minimizing credit losses and ensuring the platform's profitability. This review examines the role of advanced data analytics, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, in enhancing risk prediction capabilities.

Defaults pose a two-fold risk: lost revenue from declined applications of reliable borrowers and financial loss from approved loans that default. This dynamic necessitates models capable of accurately assessing default probabilities based on applicant characteristics and loan features. The literature reviewed in this study underscores how LendingClub leverages analytics to develop robust credit risk management frameworks.

## Methods Used

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset provided by LendingClub encompasses detailed borrower information, loan characteristics, and payment statuses. Data preprocessing involved:
- Addressing missing values.
- Removing irrelevant or redundant features.
- Creating engineered variables such as zip codes and employment length categorizations.
  
Significant correlations between numeric features were examined using heatmaps and scatterplots, revealing interdependencies that guided further feature selection.

### Machine Learning Models

Three machine learning algorithms were employed to classify borrowers into default or non-default categories:
1. *Random Forest*: An ensemble-based model utilizing decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
2. *XGBoost*: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its scalability and performance in structured data analysis.
3. *Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)*: A deep learning approach incorporating multiple hidden layers and dropout rates to enhance model generalization.

Each algorithm was evaluated based on performance metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC)

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focused on understanding the relationships between variables such as interest rates, loan terms, and debt-to-income ratios (DTI). For example:
- Higher interest rates were associated with increased default probabilities, highlighting the significance of financial burdens on repayment behavior.

## Significance of the Work

The study identified critical predictors of default risk, including:
- Interest rates
- DTI
- Subgrade
- Employment stability

These findings align with existing literature emphasizing the predictive power of financial and behavioral variables in credit scoring. Among the models employed, *ANNs delivered the best performance* with a *ROC-AUC score of 0.905*, demonstrating their capability to capture complex patterns in borrower behavior.

### Broader Implications

The findings contribute to the broader field of financial risk analytics by showcasing how machine learning can complement traditional credit risk models. Practical insights include:
- Targeting high-risk applicants with tailored loan terms or denial strategies.

## Connection to Other Work

This research builds upon foundational studies in credit risk modeling, including logistic regression approaches traditionally used in banking. However, it diverges by:
- Emphasizing the integration of dynamic data sources and machine learning algorithms.
  
Unlike static models reliant on historical averages, machine learning techniques offer:
- Real-time adaptability.
- Higher accuracy.

Several studies have explored the use of ensemble methods in financial risk prediction, with mixed results depending on data complexity and feature engineering efforts. This work demonstrates how modern techniques address limitations in traditional credit scoring systems.

## Relevance to Capstone Project

This review highlights methodologies and findings directly applicable to capstone projects focusing on risk analytics or financial modeling. Key takeaways include:
- Structured framework for data cleaning, EDA, and model evaluation.
- Emphasis on performance metrics such as ROC-AUC and precision.

Capstone projects can:
- Explore advanced modeling techniques.
- Expand feature engineering approaches.
- Investigate domain-specific applications such as small business lending or microfinance.

Understanding the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability offers valuable lessons for designing effective solutions.
